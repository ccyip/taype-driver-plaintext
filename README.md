## Dependencies

To build this library, we need the OCaml toolchain, managed by
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org).

After setting up opam and OCaml (currently best-tested on 4.14.1), install the
OCaml dependencies by:

``` sh
opam install dune
```

## Build and install

Run

``` sh
dune build
dune install
```
